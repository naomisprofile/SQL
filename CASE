#1. Display orders, account ID, total amount, and organize as 'Large' or 'Small' depending on if the order is greater or less than $3000
SELECT account_id, total_amt_usd, CASE WHEN total_amt_usd >= 3000 THEN 'large' WHEN total_amt_usd <= 2999 then 'small'  END
FROM orders;

#2. Display the number of orders in each of the following categories based on number of items in order: 'At least 2000,' 'Between 1000 and 2000,' or 'Less than 1000'
SELECT CASE WHEN total >= 2000 THEN 'At Least 2000'
	  WHEN total >= 1000 AND total < 2000 THEN 'Between 1000 and 2000'
      ELSE 'Less than 1000' END AS order_category,
COUNT(*) AS order_count
FROM orders
GROUP BY 1;

#3. Organize customer data into three levels based on lifetime purchase amount: greater than 200,000 usd, between 200,000 and 100,000 usd, under 100,000 usd.
    Include level associated with each accout, account name, total sales of all orders for customer, and level.
SELECT a.name account, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_spent, CASE WHEN SUM(o.total_amt_usd) > 200000 THEN 'level 1' WHEN SUM(o.total_amt_usd) <= 200000 AND SUM(o.total_amt_usd) > 100000 THEN 'level 2' ELSE 'level 3' END AS lifetime_value 
FROM accounts a
JOIN orders o 
ON a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY account
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

#4. Keeping the same levels from the previous question, what is the total amount spent by customers in 2016 and 2017?
SELECT a.name account, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_spent, CASE WHEN SUM(o.total_amt_usd) > 200000 THEN 'level 1' WHEN SUM(o.total_amt_usd) <= 200000 AND SUM(o.total_amt_usd) > 100000 THEN 'level 2' ELSE 'level 3' END AS lifetime_value 
FROM accounts a
JOIN orders o 
ON a.id = o.account_id
WHERE occurred_at > '2015-12-31'
GROUP BY account
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

#5. Identify sales reps associated with more than 200 orders as top performing sales reps. Include their name, total number of orders, and a labeling column denoting them as 'top' or 'not.'
SELECT s.name, COUNT(*) num_orders, CASE WHEN COUNT(*) > 200 THEN 'top' ELSE 'not' END AS sales_rep_level
FROM sales_reps s
JOIN accounts a
ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
JOIN orders o
ON a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY s.name
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

#6. Identify top performing sales reps (associated with over 200 orders or have over $750,000 in total sales). 
    Organize a middle group of reps (more than 150 orders or over $500,000 in sales).
    Idenitfy sales rep name, total number of orders, total sales across all orders, and a colum indicating top, middle, or low. 
SELECT s.name, COUNT(*) num_orders, 
	SUM (o.total_amt_usd) total_spent, 		CASE WHEN COUNT(*) > 200 OR SUM(o.total_amt_usd) > 750000 THEN 'top' 		WHEN COUNT(*) > 150 OR SUM(o.total_amt_usd) > 50000 THEN 'middle' 	ELSE 'low' END AS sales_rep_level
FROM sales_reps s
JOIN accounts a
ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
JOIN orders o
ON a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY s.name
ORDER BY 3 DESC;
